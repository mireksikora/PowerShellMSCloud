PowerShell scripts to manage Microsoft Cloud - Azure and Office

I intend to start with basic AzureAD and MS Office365 reports.
Eventually, I hope to include scripts that will not only report on, but also have ability modify AD and Office accounts.


## Repository will be populated on demand as requests come from the clinet and auditors

First Script:
AzureADUsersReport.ps1
